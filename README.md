# Self Portraits in Processing
For my Creative Coding class midterm, I spent a day coding 5 pieces of art in Processing (based on Java). These artworks use either a line pen (drawing in only straight lines) or an ellipse pen (drawing in only ellipses) to create the portraits. Creating different pens was a fun exercise in object oriented programming and inheritence. Creating different iterations using matrix manipulation, was a fun art and computer graphics exercise.

## Iteration 0: Line Pen Still
I created a function to print out my mouse's x and y coordinates, so I could later draw lines based on my mouse clicks. Resulting image is below.

## Iteration 2: Line Pen with Motion

## Iteration 3: Line Pen with Matrix Manipulation
I created a larger hat my pushing a matrix to the stack and scaling it larger, and adjusting the positioning, before drawing the hat.

## Iteration 4: Mirrored Ellipse Pen Still
I flipped the matrix for a mirrored effect, for this last iteration in the art series.
